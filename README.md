### What is Taki?

Well Taki is a multipurpose discord bot that can be activated on sites like Heroku as long as you fork the project, add in all of your own authenticator keys which I have taken out of this project and add it to your discord applications.

### Why 'Taki'?

Honestly no clue, YUI is an anime character and so is Taki, they also both end in 'I' which might have also influenced it.

### What can Taki do?

Taki's main features are his integrations with the Twitter API as well as the Reddit API, he can post on twitter from any user on discord and he can also fetch memes and such, not to mention he can also get you facts from wikipedia. All in all Taki is a web scraper if anything but he can be expanded if you wish, he also has some fun commands like kill, shoot and 8ball.
